# pixel-sketchpad

This project purpose is to build a sketchpad based on a customizable number of n x n grids.
Its features include an option to toggle the grid visualization on/off and an option to choose between "painting" and "erasing" mode.

Future implementations intended are to give the user the option to change the pencil color, as well as a form of directly saving the drawing.
